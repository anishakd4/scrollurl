			<h2>Scrurl</h2>
			<p id="cct">
		  		This doesn't work in chrome custom tabs, as it only displays the domain name in the address bar. 
		  		You'll need to open it in chrome or some other browser if you are on mobile.
			</p>
			<p>This is a thing.</p>
			<p>I didn't really make this for any reason in particular other than to prove that it was possible.</p>
			<p>
				Just in case you haven't noticed it yet, check the address bar.<br><br>
				If you still haven't noticed it, it's probably broken. If you want to make more work for me, feel free to
				give me your browser info &amp; paste any useful console output <a href="/redirects/?t=github&d=Scrurl/issues/new">here</a>. 
			</p>
			<br><br>
			<p>
				If you want to use this for your site... please don't.<br>
				If you still want to use it for your site, there are instructions <a href="/projects/scrurl">here</a>.
			</p>
			<p>Feel free to <a href="/redirects/?t=github&d=Scrurl">fork me on GitHub</a>.</p>
